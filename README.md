Task 1: Data Visualization – Plotting a Line Chart

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In Task 1, I worked on creating a clear and insightful line chart using Python to visualize trends within a dataset. The goal of this task was to understand how line charts can help reveal patterns, changes over time, and relationships between variables.

📌 What I Did

-> Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas
-> Generated a line chart using Matplotlib
-> Labeled axes and added titles for better readability
-> Analyzed the plotted data to interpret trends and insights

🛠️ Tech Stack

-> Python
-> Pandas
-> Matplotlib / Seaborn
-> Jupyter Notebook

📈 Outcome

This task helped strengthen my understanding of data visualization techniques, especially how to represent continuous data visually and interpret it effectively for data-driven insights.
